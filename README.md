## Windmill Power Prediction

#### Project Aim: To estimate the power generated by a windmill in kw/h.

#### Domain: Classical Machine Learning.

#### Achievements: 9th Rank at HackerEarth Contest of 4k Participants.

#### Objectives:
1. Power Prediction: To develop a robust model that accurately predicts windmill power based on demographic details like atmospheric conditions, windmill specifications & geographical locations.
2. Maintainance: EDA to identify the factors that contribute to much more wear and tear of a windmill which generates less power.
